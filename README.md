Ask, vote, and debate questions.

## I have no idea what I'm doing

This is my first attempt at a Rails app and I made it by following along with [Mackenzie Child's Raddit Tutorial](https://www.unicasts.com/screencasts/how-to-build-reddit-clone-rails). [Repo](https://github.com/mackenziechild/raddit)

He's excellent at sharing and I was able to deviate from recreating Reddit to creating a way of asking questions which can then be voted on and discussed.

## Roadmap

- Add MVCSS
- Give it a base layout
- Show the proof of concept to see if this is worth building for reals.
